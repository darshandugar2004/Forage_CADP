# Home Mortgage Default Analysis

## Overview
The "Home Mortgage Default Analysis" project aims to analyze borrower profiles and predict the likelihood of home loan defaults. The findings from this analysis are presented using visual dashboards, providing insights into key borrower metrics and loan characteristics.

## Objective
The primary goal of this project is to:
- Analyze borrower data to uncover patterns and trends.
- Predict home loan default chances using statistical and machine learning models.
- Provide actionable insights to improve loan underwriting and risk management processes.

## Key Features
1. **Borrower Debt to Income (DTI) Ratio**:
   - Distribution of borrowers based on DTI ratio.
   - Insights into how DTI influences the likelihood of repayment.

2. **Borrower Income Count (BIR)**:
   - Pie chart showing the proportion of borrowers with BIR greater than 0.8 versus those with BIR smaller than 0.8.
   - Indicates borrowers with comparatively less savings.

3. **Loan-to-Value (LTV) Ratio**:
   - Bar chart highlighting the percentage of borrowers with LTV greater than 80.
   - Insight into the bank's ability to recover funds in case of default.

4. **Length of Mortgage Analysis**:
   - Comparison of the average ratio of the amount paid to the amount borrowed by the length of the mortgage period.
   - Demonstrates that longer mortgage durations result in higher total repayment amounts.

5. **% Minority in Local Area**:
   - Analysis of the distribution of minority populations in localities.
   - Provides socio-economic context to the analysis.

## Key Insights
- **DTI Ratio**: 56% of borrowers have a DTI ratio of less than 30%, indicating a higher likelihood of loan repayment.
- **BIR**: 23.4% of borrowers have a BIR less than 0.8, suggesting lower savings.
- **LTV Ratio**: 66.4% of borrowers have LTV less than 80, reducing the risk for lenders.
- **Mortgage Length Impact**: Loans with longer durations lead to a higher total repayment, emphasizing the cost of extended loan periods.
- **Minority Representation**: 85 locations have minority populations exceeding 50%.

## Methodology
1. **Data Collection and Cleaning**:
   - Gathered borrower and loan data.
   - Processed and cleaned data for accuracy and consistency.

2. **Data Analysis and Visualization**:
   - Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to identify trends and patterns.
   - Created dashboards using visualization tools to present findings.

3. **Predictive Modeling**:
   - Employed machine learning models to predict default risks.
   - Models used include decision trees, random forests, and support vector machines for assessing borrower creditworthiness and risk.

4. **Process Improvement Suggestions**:
   - Recommended using NLP, image recognition, and ML to automate and accelerate underwriting processes.

## Tools and Technologies
- **Data Analysis**: Python (pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn)
- **Machine Learning**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Data Visualization**: Power BI, Tableau
- **NLP and Image Recognition**: BERT, OpenCV

## Benefits
- **Efficiency Gains**: Reduces underwriting time by up to 80%.
- **Improved Accuracy**: Enhances risk assessment accuracy through ML models.
- **Customer Satisfaction**: Enables faster loan approvals.
- **Cost Savings**: Automates document processing, reducing manual labor.

## Future Enhancements
- Integrating real-time data feeds for dynamic analysis.
- Developing a mobile application for borrower interaction and tracking.
- Expanding the predictive model to include external economic factors.
- Enhancing dashboards with interactive features for better user engagement.
